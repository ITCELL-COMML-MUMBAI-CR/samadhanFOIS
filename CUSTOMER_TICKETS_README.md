# Customer Tickets System - Implementation Guide

## Overview

This implementation replaces the old "Support & Assistance" page with a new streamlined "My Support Tickets" page for customers. The new system shows only active tickets (pending, replied, reverted) and provides specific actions for each status.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Removed Support & Assistance Page
- Removed the old three-column support assistance page
- Replaced with a new customer-focused tickets page

### 2. New Customer Tickets Page (`/customer-tickets`)
- **Location**: `public/pages/customer_tickets.php`
- **Controller**: `src/controllers/CustomerTicketsController.php`
- **CSS**: `public/css/customer_tickets.css`
- **JavaScript**: `public/js/customer_tickets.js`

### 3. Features Implemented

#### Ticket Filtering
- Shows only **pending**, **replied**, and **reverted** tickets

- Search functionality by ticket ID, type, or description
- Status-based filtering

#### Status-Specific Actions

**For Replied Tickets:**
- "Give Feedback" button

**For Reverted Tickets:**

- Text area for additional information
- Moves ticket back to pending status

**For All Tickets:**

#### Auto-Close Functionality
- Complaints in "replied" status for 3+ days are automatically closed
- Null feedback is recorded
- Transaction is logged for audit trail
- Can be triggered via cron job or on page load

### 4. Navigation Updates
- Updated navbar to show "My Support Tickets" instead of "Support & Assistance"
- Updated customer dropdown menu
- Updated customer home page quick links

### 5. API Endpoints Added
- `POST /api/complaints/feedback` - Submit customer feedback
- `POST /api/complaints/additional-info` - Submit additional information
- `GET /api/complaints/{id}` - Get ticket details
- `GET /api/complaints/{id}/history` - Get transaction history

```

## Usage Instructions

### For Customers

1. **Access Tickets Page**
   - Login as customer
   - Click "My Support Tickets" in navigation
   - Or visit `/customer-tickets`

2. **View Tickets**
   - See statistics for pending, replied, and reverted tickets
   - Use search and filters to find specific tickets
   - Click "View Details" to see full ticket information

3. **Give Feedback (Replied Tickets)**
   - Click "Give Feedback" button
   - Select rating (1-5 stars)
   - Add optional comments
   - Submit to close ticket

4. **Provide Additional Information (Reverted Tickets)**
   - Click "Add Information" button
   - Enter additional details
   - Submit to move ticket back to pending

### For Administrators

1. **Auto-Close Setup**
   - Set up cron job: `0 2 * * * /usr/bin/php /path/to/cron_auto_close.php`
   - Or auto-close runs automatically when customers visit tickets page

2. **Monitor Auto-Close**
   - Check logs in `logs/cron_auto_close.log`
   - Review auto-closed tickets in admin dashboard

## Technical Implementation

### Auto-Close Logic
```php
// In Complaint model
public function autoCloseOldComplaints() {
    // Find complaints older than 3 days in 'replied' status
    // Update status to 'closed' with null feedback
    // Log transaction for audit trail
}
```

### Security Features
- Customers can only see their own tickets
- Input validation on all forms
- CSRF protection
- SQL injection prevention
- Access control checks

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly interface
- Bootstrap-based layout
- Modern UI with animations
- Accessible design patterns

## Database Changes

No database schema changes required. The existing `complaints` table is used with:
- `status` field for ticket status
- `rating` field for customer feedback
- `rating_remarks` field for feedback comments
- `updated_at` field for tracking changes

## Migration Notes

1. **Existing Customers**: Will automatically see the new interface
2. **Old Links**: Any bookmarks to `/support/assistance` should be updated to `/customer-tickets`
3. **Auto-Close**: Will start working immediately for existing replied tickets

## Testing Checklist
